## Abstract

In this paper we tried to address two objectives through the application of machine learning techniques. The first part concerned predicting the Bitcoin close price on a 24-hours basis, while the second part concerned predicting the direction of its movement on a 24-hours basis. Accordingly, the study experimented with three deep learning techniques on one hand and model ensembling of deep learning with two tree-based techniques on the other hand. Our findings in regards to the first objective showed that the models were not able to generalize well. Slight improvements were noted when comparing the different machine learning techniques to each other. However, a naive benchmark predicting today’s price to be tomorrow’s price was established for comparison, and none of the models were able to beat it. We therefore concluded that we were not able to predict the close price of Bitcoin, and that applying machine learning techniques was not worthwhile, in our particular case, with respect to the first objective. In regards to the second objective, the underlying method was model ensembling of different machine learning techniques. Our findings indicated some improvements in performance through model ensembling in comparison to the respective models' individual performances. However, the models' performances did not suggest predictability of the directions of the Bitcoin movement. Applying machine learning techniques to answer these two objectives, was therefore not as successful as one would hope, and thereby this project, provides further arguments towards the unpredictabililty of the cryptocurrency market. 

## Corse description

Deep learning is the latest frontier in using computers to analyze data.  Most of the most glamorous advances in AI, such as voice recognition and automatic translation, are made possible by deep learning.

In this class, we will explore whether deep learning can be used to predict financial markets.  Deep learning requires immense amounts of data, so we choose a market where such data is readily available: cryptocurrency markets, such as Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrency markets are a very promising area of application, because data is readily available and because the market is dominated by small retail investors who are more likely to engage in predictable patterns.

**Models**
